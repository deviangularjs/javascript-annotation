This program gives JavaScript developers an easy way to create modular JavaScript by providing means to load files with a Java preprocessor. This is particularly useful for developing JavaScript libraries. For JavaScript applications, systems like AngularJS are more appropriate.

# Usage #

`java -jar jsa.jar file1.js`

# Examples #

```
/*Load a file into another JavaScript file and save the output*/

//@load test2.js
//@load http://www.dahmian.com/example.js
//@save exampleSavedOutput.js
```
